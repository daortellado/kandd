    <div id="our-story" class="section">
        <h2 class="save-the-date">New Year's Eve, 2008</h2>
        <p>We met in the halls of our high schools, De La Salle and Carondelet, 
            passing each other on the way to our respective sports practices and music shows.</p>
        <p>But it was on New Year's Eve our Junior year that sparks began to fly. And soon, we became adventurers together,
            going to citywide pillowfights and, most notably, lighthouses together (a tradition we carry on to this day!)
        </p>
        <img src="plane.png" alt="Plane" class="plane">
        <p>After several years of long distance between our college campuses of Princeton and Berkeley, and with lots of extra
            distance in between (summers in Australia, Spain, Nicaragua, and Mexico bookended our time apart - postcards aplenty!),
            we finally moved in together in Washington, DC and eventually made our way back to the west (best) coast.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="the-ring" class="section">
        <h2 class="save-the-date">The Ring</h2>
        <p>We had our ring custom made by the wonderful Carol at Arareity Jewelers in Sacramento. The ring is an homage to
            heirloom rings from Damian's side of the family in Brittany, France.
        </p>

        <p><i>
            Black walnut: Represents our East Bay hometown<br>
            Coastal live oak: Represents Sacramento, where we've settled<br>
            Emeralds apart: Represents our distance love<br>
            Unifying diamond: Represents our current life together

    <div id="the-proposal" class="section">
        <h2 class="save-the-date">The Proposal</h2>
        <p>Damian surprised Katelyn by proposing to her at the lighthouse in Manistee, Michigan. The location has a special 
            significance because Katelyn's grandparents are originally from the nearby Grand Rapids - which is incidentally 
            also where Damian's father had his first experience as an exchange student in the United States! Katelyn took some pictures with the ring 
            at her grandma's childhood home to commemorate the moment.

        <h2 class="save-the-date">Welcome to the coast</h2>
        <p>Montara is a small town off the coast of California, a little under a half hour south of San Francisco.
            Damian and Katelyn chose this location because of the proximity to family and friends, but also because of well,
            let's face it: the lighthouse!

                    <li>Devil's Slide Trail (and Devil's Bunker): The old highway route before they built the tunnels -- stunning views, bench seating available, and paved. About 1.3 miles one way.</li>
                    <li>Grey Whale Cove Trail: Moderate difficulty trail with some elevation. Amazing ocean views overlooking Highway 1. Keep your eyes peeled for migrating whales!</li>
                    <li>JV Fitzgerald Marine Reserve: A favorite place to check out the tide pools - check the tide levels if you'd like to visit closer to low tide. The Bluff Trail takes you right along the ocean with outlook points where you can often find the sea lions basking on the beaches.</li>
